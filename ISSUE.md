HCTWMAN-29: goircbotd: Extension system
----------
http://tracker.dev.hellcat.net/browse/HCTWMAN-29

System to easiely "install" extension into the bot.
Idealy a special folder where additional code files just need to be placed in (files following special rules).
We might need to create one central initextension.go where an init() or setup() or whatever() call needs to be added for every new extension....
